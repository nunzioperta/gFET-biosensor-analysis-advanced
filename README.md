# gFET-biosensor-analysis-advanced
This Python script processes data from graphene FET measurements by reading structured input files, extracting voltage and current data across multiple channels, and performing statistical analyses like t-tests. It visualizes results using Matplotlib, enabling clear interpretation of device performance trends and variability.
